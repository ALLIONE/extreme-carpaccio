## Instructions
1. Go to the sellers view and register yourself (URL example: http://192.168.1.12:8080/)
2. The server will start sending orders like this:

    ```
    POST /order HTTP/1.1
    {
        "prices": [65.6,27.26,32.68],
        "quantities": [6,8,10],
        "country": "IE"
    }
    ```

3. You should calculate the total and answer with an object bill, i.e.: `{ "total": 1000.0 }`
4. Your score will be shown in the dashboard

To calculate the bill, you need to consider the tax of the country from which the order came from and the reduction.
